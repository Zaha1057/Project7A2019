      <p>Mariyam Zaha is a student studying in middle school. She dislikes the waste management in her local surroundings and participates in her school's plastic collection program as a small token to the environment. Her school being one of the schools, providing its students the opportunity to serve the environment, including people, plants, animals, etc</p>
      <p>In the academic year 2019, the students had to make a website about one of the problems faced by their society for their computer science project. Zaha chose the topic waste management without any hesitation, hoping to achieve good marks that term. However, this very website you are looking at now, is more than just a lousy school project, it is a message to all the readers, encouraging them to play their role in the environment, in order to help maintain a healthy world for the future generations to come.</p>
